<h1 id="wb-cont"><small>Implementation of the Canada-United States-Mexico Agreement (CUSMA) <i lang="la">De Minimis</i> Thresholds with Respect to Customs Duties and Taxes for Courier Imports</small><br />
Customs Notice 20-18</h1>

<p><b>Ottawa, May 02, 2020</b></p>

</header>

<p>1.	Further to Customs Notice <a href="/publications/cn-ad/cn20-14-eng.html">20-14</a>, Implementation of the <a href="https://www.international.gc.ca/trade-commerce/trade-agreements-accords-commerciaux/agr-acc/cusma-aceum/index.aspx?lang=eng"><span class="nowrap">Canada-United</span> <span class="nowrap">States-Mexico</span> Agreement (CUSMA)</a>, dated <time datetime="2020-04-03" class="nowrap">April 3, 2020</time>, this notice provides information related to the implementation of the <abbr>CUSMA</abbr> <i lang="la">de minimis</i> thresholds with respect to the application of customs duties and taxes on goods imported into Canada and transported by courier from the United States or Mexico.</p>

<p>2.	Under <abbr>CUSMA</abbr>, Canada has agreed to maintain a <i lang="la">de minimis</i> threshold of at least CAD$150.00 for customs duties, and CAD$40.00 for taxes, at the time or point of importation of goods shipped by courier from the United States or Mexico. There are otherwise no changes to Canada’s existing <i lang="la">de minimis</i> framework. Accordingly, postal shipments from the U.S. or Mexico, as well as any courier or postal shipments from any other country, will continue to have a customs duty and tax remission threshold value of up to CAD$20.00. Please note that the new thresholds will apply as of the date the <abbr>CUSMA</abbr> enters into force and, for greater clarity, time of importation means the time of release.</p>

<h2 class="h3">Implementation of the <abbr>CUSMA</abbr> <i lang="la">de minimis</i> threshold</h2>

<p>3.	The <abbr>CUSMA</abbr> customs duty and taxation <i lang="la">de minimis</i> commitments are being implemented through changes to the <a href="https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/E-15/"><cite>Excise Tax Act</cite></a> and the <a href="https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/SI-85-182/"><cite>Courier Imports Remission Order</cite></a>.</p>

<p>4.	The <a href="https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/E-15/"><cite>Excise Tax Act</cite></a> is being amended by clause&nbsp;39 of <a href="https://www.parl.ca/LegisInfo/BillDetails.aspx?Language=E&billId=10615191"><span class="nowrap">Bill C-4</span></a>, <cite><span class="nowrap">Canada–United</span> <span class="nowrap">States–Mexico</span> Agreement Implementation Act</cite>, on the date <abbr>CUSMA</abbr> enters into force.</p>

<p>5.	The <a href="https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/SI-85-182/"><cite>Courier Imports Remission Order</cite></a> is also being amended and this amendment will also enter into effect on the date the <abbr>CUSMA</abbr> enters into force.</p>

<h3>The <cite>Courier Imports Remission Order</cite> upon <abbr>CUSMA</abbr> entry into force</h3>

<p>6.	As defined in the <a href="https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/SI-85-182/"><cite>Courier Imports Remission Order</cite></a> (CIRO) “<strong>courier</strong> means a commercial carrier that is engaged in scheduled international transportation of shipments of goods other than goods imported by mail”.</p>

<p>7.	Upon entry into force of the <abbr>CUSMA</abbr>, the following provisions will apply to <strong>imported goods</strong> that are <strong>transported by courier into Canada</strong>:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Goods with a value for duty of CAD$20.00 or less will have any applicable customs duties and taxes waived when imported from any country;</li>
	<li>Goods with a value for duty CAD$20.01 or greater that are imported from any country other than the United States or Mexico will continue to be subject to any applicable duties and taxes;</li>
	<li>Goods with a value for duty of CAD$40.00 or less will have any applicable customs duties and taxes waived when imported from the United States or Mexico only;</li> 
	<li>Goods with a value for duty of CAD$40.01 or greater, up to and including CAD$150.00, will be free of customs duties (however, taxes will remain applicable) when imported from the United States or Mexico only; and</li>
	<li>Goods with a value for duty CAD$150.01 or greater will be subject to any applicable duties and taxes when imported from any country, including the United States or Mexico.</li>
</ul>

<p>8.	In order to qualify for the CAD$40.00 or CAD$150.00 <i lang="la">de minimis</i> thresholds set out in the CUSMA, the goods do not need to originate according to the <abbr>CUSMA</abbr> <a href="https://www.international.gc.ca/trade-commerce/assets/pdfs/agreements-accords/cusma-aceum/r-cusma-04.pdf">Chapter&nbsp;4, Rules of Origin</a>, but rather be imported from the United States or Mexico. If the goods were not produced in the United States or Mexico, they must have entered into the commerce of either the United States or Mexico prior to being imported into Canada in order to benefit from the <abbr>CUSMA</abbr> <i lang="la">de minimis</i> relief. For greater certainty, goods that are shipped from a <span class="nowrap">non-<abbr>CUSMA</abbr></span> country and transit or are <span class="nowrap">trans-shipped</span> through the United States or Mexico, without having entered the commerce of the <abbr>CUSMA</abbr> partners, would not be entitled to the CAD$40.00 or CAD$150.00 <i lang="la">de minimis</i> thresholds.</p>

<h3>Exceptions: Goods for which the relief does not apply</h3>

<p>9.	As per Section 3 “Application” and the definition of “goods” of the <a href="https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/SI-85-182/"><abbr>CIRO</abbr></a>, as well as sections 7 and 7.01 of Schedule VII to the <a href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/e-15/"><cite>Excise Tax Act</cite></a>, certain types of commercial transactions and imported goods, despite being transported by courier, are <strong>not</strong> eligible for remission of customs duties <span class="nowrap">and/or</span> taxes (e.g., alcohol and tobacco products). The treatment of these transactions and goods is not affected by the <abbr>CUSMA</abbr> and will remain the same after the <abbr>CUSMA</abbr> enters into force. For more information, please refer to the corresponding sections of the <abbr>CIRO</abbr> and the <cite>Excise Tax Act</cite> and applicable regulations.</p>

<p>10.	In order for courier shipments to receive the benefit of the <a href="https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/SI-85-182/"><abbr>CIRO</abbr></a>, or the benefit of <span class="nowrap">non-taxable</span> status under Schedule VII to the <a href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/e-15/"><cite>Excise Tax Act</cite></a>, <strong>both as amended upon <abbr>CUSMA</abbr>’s entry into force</strong>, the value for duty must reflect all items that are part of an order by a customer and that are imported, even if the goods are shipped separately at different times or from different warehouses. It is not permitted to divide an order into several packages so that each individual shipment has a value for duty not exceeding CAD$20.00 from any country or CAD$40.00 from the United States or Mexico.</p>

<p>11.	As well, the <a href="https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/SI-85-182/"><abbr>CIRO</abbr></a> does not apply to postal importations. The <a href="https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/SI-85-181/FullText.html"><cite>Postal Imports Remission Order</cite></a> will continue to apply to goods imported by mail from any country and is not being amended – it will thus continue to establish a threshold of a value for duty not exceeding CAD$20.00. For more information regarding the <cite>Postal Imports Remission Order</cite>, please see <a href="/publications/dm-md/d8/d8-2-2-eng.html"><span class="nowrap">Memorandum D8-2-2</span>, Postal Imports Remission Order</a>.</p>

<h3>How to claim the benefits of the <abbr>CIRO</abbr></h3>

<h4>Report</h4>

<p>12.	Section 12(1) of the <a href="https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/c-52.6/page-1.html"><cite>Customs Act</cite></a> requires that all imported goods be reported to the Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA). Section&nbsp;12(3) of the Customs Act outlines by whom the reporting must be completed and is further detailed in <a href="/publications/dm-md/d3/d3-1-1-eng.html"><span class="nowrap">Memorandum D3-1-1</span>, Policy Respecting the Importation and Transportation of Goods</a>.</p>

<h4>Release</h4>

<p>13.	<strong>Courier Low Value Shipment (CLVS) Program participants</strong> may claim the <a href="https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/SI-85-182/"><abbr>CIRO</abbr></a> or the benefit of <span class="nowrap">non-taxable</span> status under Schedule VII to the <a href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/e-15/"><cite>Excise Tax Act</cite></a> when requesting the release of eligible goods, by presenting to the <abbr>CBSA</abbr> with a <span class="nowrap">Cargo/Release</span> List (Consist Sheet) as per the information found in <a href="/publications/dm-md/d8/d8-2-16-eng.html"><span class="nowrap">Memorandum D8-2-16</span>, Courier Imports Remission</a> or <a href="/publications/dm-md/d17/d17-4-0-eng.html"><span class="nowrap">Memorandum D17-4-0</span>, Courier Low Value Shipment Program</a>. <span class="nowrap">Memorandum D8-2-16</span> will be updated with information pertaining to the <abbr>CUSMA</abbr> commitments prior to the time that the <abbr>CUSMA</abbr> enters into force.</p>

<p>14.	In order to claim the <a href="https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/SI-85-182/"><abbr>CIRO</abbr></a> (including the <abbr>CUSMA</abbr> <i lang="la">de minimis</i>) or the benefit of <span class="nowrap">non-taxable</span> status under Schedule VII to the <a href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/e-15/"><cite>Excise Tax Act</cite></a>, the additional separation of the <abbr>CIRO</abbr> categories on the <span class="nowrap">Cargo/Release</span> List is required as follows:</p>

<ul> 
	<li><strong>Category A</strong>:  <abbr>CLVS</abbr> <abbr>CIRO</abbr> shipments with a value for duty of CAD$0 - $20.00 (other than those imported from the United States or Mexico);</li>

	<li><strong>Category D</strong>:  <abbr>CLVS</abbr> shipments where duties and taxes are applicable (imported from all countries).</li>
</ul>

<p>15.	<strong>Couriers that are not a <abbr>CLVS</abbr> Program participant</strong> may claim the <a href="https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/SI-85-182/"><abbr>CIRO</abbr></a> or the benefit of <span class="nowrap">non-taxable</span> status under Schedule&nbsp;VII to the <a href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/e-15/"><cite>Excise Tax Act</cite></a> when requesting the release of eligible goods, by presenting a Cargo Control Document to the <abbr>CBSA</abbr>. A Cargo Control Document is a manifest or other control document that acts as the record of a shipment entering Canada. Further information regarding the Cargo Control Document can be found in <a href="/publications/dm-md/d3/d3-1-1-eng.html"><span class="nowrap">Memorandum D3-1-1</span>, Policy Respecting the Importation and Transportation of Goods</a>.</p>
 
<p>16.	When claiming the <a href="https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/SI-85-182/"><abbr>CIRO</abbr></a> or the benefit of <span class="nowrap">non-taxable</span> status under Schedule VII to the <a href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/e-15/"><cite>Excise Tax Act</cite></a> for imported goods transported by courier, the Cargo Control Document presented to the <abbr>CBSA</abbr> in the release of goods must clearly state, among other data requirements:</p>

	<li>a value for duty of the goods at CAD$0 to $20.00, to ensure eligibility under the <abbr>CIRO</abbr> thresholds and <span class="nowrap">non-taxable</span> status under Section&nbsp;7 of Schedule VII to the <a href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/e-15/"><cite>Excise Tax Act</cite></a>; and</li>
	<li>the <abbr>CIRO</abbr> Order in Council <span class="nowrap">number 85-2955</span> (for goods with a value for duty CAD$0 to $20.00).</li>
